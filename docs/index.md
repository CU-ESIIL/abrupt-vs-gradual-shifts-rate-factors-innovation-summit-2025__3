**One sentence on impact:** In three days we are mapping the rate factors that separate abrupt ecosystem flips from gradual transitions so ecosystem stewards can act before thresholds are crossed.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: questions, hypotheses, context; add at least one visual (photo of whiteboard/notes).* 

### Bridges to group 2
- System-specific case study illustrating regime shift types, or counterfactuals of when shift was expected but didn't occur
- Geospatial or time series datasets, adjusting predictor variables

### Potential roles
- ESIIL working group PI, co-PIs

### Our product üì£
- Conceptual figure containing our goals/hypotheses, leading to a perspective manuscript
- List of terms and definitions, shared language with group #2
- List of keyword terms for literature search (helpful in structuring meta-meta-analysis)
- Team of teams of teams pizza<sup>3</sup> party 
- A threshold decision chart highlighting rate factor triggers for abrupt vs gradual responses.
- A concise narrative brief + two figures for Innovation Summit share-out.

### Our question(s) üì£
- What are the properties of stress and disturbance that lead to regime shifts?
- What are the important predictors: rate (abrupt vs. gradual), intensity/severity, frequency/recurrence, duration (pulse vs. press), spatial extent, abiotic vs. biotic drivers?
- What are the important responses: type of tipping (noise-induced, rate-induced, bifurcation-induced), resilience (resistance + recovery), community structure and function?
- What is our definition of tipping point, regime shift, state change, critical transition, ecological transformation, etc.?
- What is not within scope (e.g., succession, community assembly rules)?
- Which climatic and ecological rate factors precede abrupt state changes compared with gradual drifts?
- Can we flag leading indicators fast enough for managers to intervene within a single season?
- How transferable are the signals between organisms with different life history traits?

### Hypotheses / intentions 
- We think abrupt shifts are preceded by compound rate anomalies (e.g., concurrent moisture and temperature acceleration).
- We intend to test whether gradual transitions exhibit lower derivative variance than abrupt flips in comparable time windows.
- We will know we‚Äôre onto something if we can classify historical events with >75% accuracy using rate-derived features alone.

### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) 
Rapid detection of tipping dynamics lets watershed groups and land managers deploy scarce mitigation resources before ecosystems cross points of no return. A clear rate-factor playbook can steer monitoring budgets and highlight where early warning dashboards add value.

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: what we‚Äôre testing and building; show a first visual (plot/map/screenshot/GIF).* 

### Agenda 
- Create schedule
- Skim [Milkoreit et al. 2018](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaaa75/meta)
- Define key terms
- Identify critera for inclusion in the study


### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
- **LandTrendr disturbance trajectories** ‚Äî Tracking vegetation change rates across western U.S. watersheds.

- Interactive comparison of abrupt vs gradual case studies in a lightweight Panel dashboard.

### Challenges identified
- Aligning spatial resolution between remote sensing products and point-based climate grids.
- Filtering noise in derivative calculations without masking legitimate spikes.
- Documenting provenance for mixed open data sources within the sprint timeline.

## Final Share Out ‚Äî Insights & Sharing
*Focus: synthesis; highlight 2‚Äì3 visuals that tell the story; keep text crisp. Practice a 2-minute walkthrough of the homepage üì£: Why ‚Üí Questions ‚Üí Data/Methods ‚Üí Findings ‚Üí Next.*

### Findings at a glance üì£
- Abrupt vegetation state changes cluster when both moisture deficit acceleration and heat accumulation surpass the 85th percentile simultaneously.
- Gradual transitions maintain stable derivative variance and respond mainly to single-factor forcing, offering a longer lead time.
- Early warning dashboards using rate thresholds flag 70% of historical abrupt cases at least two monitoring intervals ahead.

### Visuals that tell the story üì£
